# phpwebsite-mangation
For my manga website - "Mangation"

You can import the database from the database folder into mySQL
Then use XAMPP to run the project using localhost

To access the website after importing all data and running XAMPP:
1. Go to google
2. Click the link bar
3. Type either...
    - For the FRONT PAGE - http://localhost/phpwebsite/home.php
    - For the ADMIN PAGE - http://localhost/phpwebsite/admin/login.php

        For access to your local database's admin page
        Your login details will be:
        Username - admin
        Password - admin1

This website demonstrates PHP, HTML and CSS
